    <h2>Computer network</h2>
    <p>
      A computer network is a digital telecommunications network which allows nodes to share resources.
      In computer networks, computing devices exchange data with each other using connections (data links) between
      nodes.
      These data links are established over cable media such as wires or optic cables, or wireless media such as Wi-Fi.
      Network computer devices that originate, route and terminate the data are called network nodes.
      Nodes are generally identified by network addresses, and can include hosts such as personal computers,
      phones, and servers, as well as networking hardware such as routers and switches.
      Two such devices can be said to be networked together when one device is able to exchange information
      with the other device, whether or not they have a direct connection to each other.
      In most cases, application-specific communications protocols are layered (i.e. carried as payload)
      over other more general communications protocols.
      This formidable collection of information technology requires skilled network management to keep it all running
      reliably.
      Computer networks support an enormous number of applications and services such as access to the World Wide Web,
      digital video, digital audio, shared use of application and storage servers, printers, and fax machines,
      and use of email and instant messaging applications as well as many others.
      Computer networks differ in the transmission medium used to carry their signals,
      communications protocols to organize network traffic, the network's size,
      topology, traffic control mechanism and organizational intent. The best-known computer network is the Internet.
